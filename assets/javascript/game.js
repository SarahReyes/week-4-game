//user's sum box increments by the value of the button, each time a button is clicked


//user wins if their total sum is equal to the random computer pick


//user continues to play if their sum is < the random computer pick


//user loses if their sum is > the random computer pick


//the game re-starts when the user wins or loses


//if the user wins, display win++, if the user loses, display losses++


//when the game re-starts, the computer picks a new random number between 19 - 120
